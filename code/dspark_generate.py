"""DSpark block-diffusion speculative decoding.

One draft forward yields a whole block of candidate tokens rather than `k`
sequential forwards, so the drafting overhead is a single 1.36B pass regardless
of block width. On a latency-bound machine that is the point: widening the block
is nearly free, while widening an autoregressive drafter is not.

The awkward part on a hybrid target is the rewind. Its linear-attention layers
carry a recurrent state with no per-token structure to cut, so a partially
accepted block cannot be trimmed back — the state has to be restored wholesale
and the accepted tokens replayed. Done naively that is a second full target pass
per step, which costs more than the speculation wins (measured: 0.4x plain).

So the replay is not performed. Accepted-but-unreplayed tokens are carried in
`pending` and prepended to the *next* step's verification, which the target has
to run anyway. That is one target pass per step at any acceptance rate.
